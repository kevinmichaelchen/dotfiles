You have a few key MCP tools: `perplexity`, `nia`, `deepwiki`, and `codex`.

- Perplexity, for deep research and web searches (great for domain research)
- Nia, for supplementary research about repositories and docs sites (great for
  going in-depth on tools, libraries and frameworks)
- deepwiki - similar to nia, but maybe not as good?
- codex - for delegating code reviews to the powerful GPT 5.2 model
